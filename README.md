# Applied Spiral Dynamics: Developmental Companion

## Elevator Pitch

We're building an AI companion that maps your belief structure through natural conversation. Unlike standard chatbots that forget context, this system extracts "belief pixels" from your conversations, visualizes them in a 3D space organized by developmental stage (Spiral Dynamics), and uses this accumulated understanding to provide increasingly personalized guidance over time.

**The bigger vision:** Your pixel map becomes a personal data asset you own. As it grows richer, content platforms can query it ("Is this a match for this user?") without ever seeing your actual data - just getting yes/no answers. This breaks data monopolies and returns algorithmic control to users.

**Demo at Edge City:** 2-week build showcasing the core developmental companion with real-time pixel extraction and visualization.

## Getting Started

This repository contains the complete technical specification for building the Developmental Companion. Read through the sections in order - each builds on the previous one.

### Section 1: Product Overview
**Start here to understand what we're building and why**

What you'll learn:
- Core concept and innovation
- Use cases and success metrics
- Why this matters for developers
- Edge City demo objectives

[→ Read Section 1: Technical Specification](https://github.com/mettafive/applied-spiral-dynamics/blob/main/Technical%20Specification.md)

---

### Section 2: User Experience
**Move on here to see how users interact with the system**

What you'll learn:
- Complete user journey from first session to long-term use
- How pixel extraction feels to users (invisible but magical)
- The "aha moment" when developmental guidance kicks in
- Interface states and what to build (UX layer)
- Pixel lifecycle: creation, activation, evolution, archiving
- How beliefs evolve over time (history tracking)

[→ Read Section 2: User Experience](https://github.com/mettafive/applied-spiral-dynamics/blob/main/User%20Experience.md)

### Section 3: System Architecture
**Then dive into the technical architecture and data flow**

What you'll learn:
- High-level architecture diagram (4 components)
- Detailed sequence flow (what happens when user sends a message)
- Technology stack options (LLM wrappers, databases, hosting)
- Context window management strategy
- Failure modes and error handling
- Edge City demo technical setup

[→ Read Section 3: System Architecture](https://github.com/mettafive/applied-spiral-dynamics/blob/main/System%20Architecture.md)

---

### Section 4: Technical Components
**Finally, get the detailed implementation guides and prompts**

What you'll learn:
- **Interpreter Guide:** How to extract belief pixels (with Spiral Dynamics stage descriptions)
- **Insight Model Guide:** How to provide developmental guidance (let Green emerge naturally from releasing Orange)
- **PM Handler:** Vector search and pixel family logic
- **Main LLM:** System prompts and constraints
- Chat interface implementation options
- Unit testing framework
- Developer checklist for each component
