**Status:** Draft

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 What We're Building

A conversational AI system that builds a persistent, visual map of a user's belief structure through natural dialogue. The system extracts discrete "belief pixels" from conversations, organizes them in a 3D space by topic and developmental stage (Spiral Dynamics framework), and uses this accumulated context to provide increasingly personalized developmental guidance.

**Key Innovation:** Unlike standard LLM interfaces that treat each conversation in isolation, this system creates a growing understanding of the user's worldview that informs every future interaction.

### 1.2 Use Case

**Primary:** Personal development work - users seeking to understand their own belief structures and evolve through developmental stages (Spiral Dynamics: Beige → Purple → Red → Blue → Orange → Green → Yellow → Turquoise → Coral → Teal)

**Demo Context:** Edge City presentation showing agentic AI architecture with persistent memory and developmental intelligence

### 1.3 Core User Experience

1. User signs in and chats naturally with the AI
2. System silently extracts belief statements that meet quality thresholds
3. Extracted beliefs appear as colored pixels in a 3D map (right panel)
4. When user mentions topics connected to existing pixels, those pixels "activate" (visual stroke) and their context enriches the conversation
5. Over time, the AI develops deep understanding of user's worldview and can guide developmental transitions

### 1.4 This project demonstrates:


- **Prompt chaining architecture** - multiple specialized LLM calls working in sequence
- **Vector embeddings + semantic search** for contextual memory
- **Real-time 3D visualization** of abstract data
- **Structured extraction** from unstructured conversation
- **Developmental psychology** applied to AI interaction design

### 1.5 Success Metrics (Edge City Demo)

- User can have 10-minute conversation and see 5-10 pixels extracted
- Pixel map clusters visually by topic
- Follow-up conversation shows activated pixels and contextually aware responses
- Audience understands the developmental guidance mechanism
